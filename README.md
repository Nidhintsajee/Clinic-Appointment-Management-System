# Clinic Appointment Management System API

A Django REST API for a platform that allows multiple independent clinics to manage their appointments. Each clinic operates independently with their own doctors and patients. Doctors may work at multiple clinics with different availability at each. Patients can register and book appointments at any clinic.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-clinic support**: Each clinic operates independently
- **Doctor management**: Doctors can work at multiple clinics with different availability
- **Patient registration**: Patients can register and book appointments at any clinic
- **Appointment scheduling**: Smart scheduling with duration-based time slots
- **Overlap prevention**: No double-booking of doctors
- **Availability checking**: Get available time slots based on doctor's schedule
- **Role-based access control**: Different permissions for patients, doctors, and staff
- **Comprehensive API**: RESTful endpoints for all operations

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django 5.2 + Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication
- **Testing**: Django Test Framework with coverage reporting

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- pip (Python package manager)

## 🔐 Permission Model

- **Patients**: Can view/manage their own appointments and profile
- **Doctors**: Can manage their availability and view their appointments
- **Staff/Admins**: Full access to all resources
- **Public**: Can view clinics and check available slots

## 📊 Data Models

### Clinic
- `name`, `address`, `phone`, `email`
- `operating_hours_start`, `operating_hours_end`

### Doctor
- Linked to User model
- `specialization`, `license_number`
- Many-to-many with Clinic through DoctorClinicAvailability

### Patient
- Linked to User model
- `date_of_birth`, `phone`, `emergency_contact`

### VisitType
- `name`, `duration_minutes`
- Linked to Clinic

### Appointment
- Links: Patient, Doctor, Clinic, VisitType
- `scheduled_time`, `end_time`, `status`, `notes`
- Automatic end_time calculation based on visit type duration
- Overlap prevention validation

### DoctorClinicAvailability
- Links: Doctor, Clinic
- `day_of_week`, `start_time`, `end_time`

## 🎯 Core Scheduling Logic

### Available Slots Calculation
The system calculates available time slots by:
1. Checking doctor's availability for the specific clinic and day
2. Considering existing appointments
3. Accounting for visit type duration
4. Preventing overlaps (with optional buffer time)

### Overlap Prevention
- No two appointments can overlap for the same doctor
- Only `scheduled` appointments block time slots
- `cancelled` and `completed` appointments don't block scheduling

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database connection failed**
   - Check PostgreSQL is running: `sudo systemctl status postgresql`
   - Verify credentials in `.env` file
   - Ensure database exists: `sudo -u postgres psql -c "\l"`

2. **401 Unauthorized errors**
   - Use `Authorization: Token your-token-here` (not Bearer)
   - Ensure token is valid (login again if needed)

3. **Migration errors**
   - Delete `db.sqlite3` and migration files
   - Run: `python manage.py makemigrations` then `python manage.py migrate`

4. **Test failures**
   - Ensure test database permissions: `ALTER USER clinic_user CREATEDB;`
   - Or use SQLite for testing by modifying `settings.py`

### Logs
Check Django server logs for detailed error messages.
